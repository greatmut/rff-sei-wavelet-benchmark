# rff-sei-wavelet-benchmark
Wavelet Transform is the best time-frequency algorithm/technique. Widely implemented in several engineering fields. These files are for a project to determine the best choice of wavelet (wavelet type) for Radio frequency signals used to extract device fingerprint features for Specific Emitter Identification.
